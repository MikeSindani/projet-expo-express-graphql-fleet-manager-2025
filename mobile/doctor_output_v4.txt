Ô£û Check that no duplicate dependencies are installed
Your project contains duplicate native module dependencies, which should be de-duplicated.
Native builds may only contain one version of any given native module, and having multiple versions of a single Native module installed may lead to unexpected build errors.
Found duplicates for expo-constants:
  Ôö£ÔöÇ expo-constants@18.0.13 (at: node_modules\expo-constants)
  Ôö£ÔöÇ expo-constants@18.0.13 (at: node_modules\expo\node_modules\expo-constants)

Advice:
Your node_modules folder may be corrupted. Multiple copies of the same version exist for: expo-constants, expo-font.
- Try deleting your node_modules folders and reinstall your dependencies after.
- If this error persists, delete your node_modules as well as your lockfile and reinstall.
