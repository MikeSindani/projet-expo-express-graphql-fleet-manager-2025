✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
✖ Check that no duplicate dependencies are installed
Your project contains duplicate native module dependencies, which should be de-duplicated.
Native builds may only contain one version of any given native module, and having multiple versions of a single Native module installed may lead to unexpected build errors.
Found duplicates for expo-constants:
  ├─ expo-constants@18.0.13 (at: node_modules\expo-constants)
  ├─ expo-constants@18.0.13 (at: node_modules\expo\node_modules\expo-constants)
  └─ expo-constants@18.0.13 (at: node_modules\expo-asset\node_modules\expo-constants)
Found duplicates for expo-font:
  ├─ expo-font@14.0.11 (at: node_modules\expo-font)
  └─ expo-font@14.0.11 (at: node_modules\expo\node_modules\expo-font)
Advice:
Your node_modules folder may be corrupted. Multiple copies of the same version exist for: expo-constants, expo-font.
- Try deleting your node_modules folders and reinstall your dependencies after.
- If this error persists, delete your node_modules as well as your lockfile and reinstall.
